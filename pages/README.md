# Pages Directory (Legacy Routing)

**Note:** This project primarily uses the Next.js App Router (in the `/app` directory).

This directory exists for legacy or transitional purposes. If you need to add new routes, please use the App Router in the `/app` directory instead.

## Migration Guidelines

When migrating pages from the Pages Router to the App Router:

1. Create the corresponding route in the `/app` directory
2. Ensure it works with the App Router patterns
3. Remove the file from this directory
